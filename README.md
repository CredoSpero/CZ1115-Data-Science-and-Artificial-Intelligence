Our project is contained in the notebook "DSAI Project Team 5", all the information, code and data can be found in the notebook itself.
The PowerPoint presentation slides is also included in the file, titled "DSAI Stocks Presentation".

Our project aims to develop an algorithm to identify out of a given set of companies, the most investment-worthy of them. 
This is done through a cluster-based approach using 4 key financial metrics. 
This gives us and investors, a more informed decision backed by data analysis, thereby strengthening and diversifying our portfolio to maximise gains
